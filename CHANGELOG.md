# Changelog

## 0.2.0

Tracing and `generate` are no longer tied to Claude Code.

- **One command to get going.** Running `repo-map` with no command (or `npx @whitemane/repo-map`) now sets up whatever is missing, asking only when it has to: the map's name, code folders and description; which AI tool to use, from those found on the machine (Claude Code, a running Ollama or LM Studio, Codex, Gemini, OpenAI) or skip; and whether to draft the map. Then it opens the map in the browser, moving to the next port if 4477 is taken. Without a terminal it never asks. `repo-map serve` still starts the map with no setup steps.
- **Starter map without AI.** If you skip the AI tool, or drafting fails, the map starts with one card per folder instead of being empty.

- **Choose your AI tool.** New `ai.provider` setting: `claude` (Claude Code CLI), `api` (any OpenAI-compatible API, hosted or local, e.g. OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio), `command` (any CLI, with presets for Codex CLI and Gemini CLI), `none`, or `auto` (the default: Claude Code if installed, then an API if configured, then a command).
- **Personal AI settings** in `~/.config/repo-map/ai.json` or a git-ignored `.repo-map/local.json`, plus `--provider` / `--model` flags and `REPO_MAP_*` env vars, so each person can use their own tool without changing the shared config.
- **`repo-map doctor`** shows which AI tool will be used and checks that it works (for APIs, without spending tokens).
- **Scripted setup.** Every step is a non-interactive command that's safe to re-run:
  - `repo-map ai <tool>` (claude, openai, api, ollama, lmstudio, codex, gemini, command, auto, none) saves the AI choice with `--global` (default), `--local` or `--repo`; `repo-map ai show` prints the settings in effect.
  - `repo-map init --name --roots --context --github` sets the essentials without editing JSON, and updates an existing config when re-run with flags.
  - `repo-map generate --if-missing` does nothing when a map already exists.
  - `repo-map doctor --json` prints machine-readable status and exits 1 when tracing is off.
  - Unknown flags now fail with an error instead of being ignored, and `--flag=value` works.
- **Clearer failures.** Traces explain whether the tool isn't installed, isn't signed in, has no access, hit a limit, or doesn't know the model, with what to do next.
- **No-AI mode in the UI.** When no tool is set up, the trace box says so, explains how to enable one, and points to importing a teammate's trace code.
- **SETUP.md** and **CONTRIBUTING.md** with full setup, provider and release instructions.
- Fixed: code references were dropped from traces in repos whose code isn't under `services/` or `packages/`.
- Fixed: a CLI that exits before reading its prompt no longer crashes the server.
- 0.1.x configs with a top-level `"claude"` block keep working.

## 0.1.0

First release.

- `repo-map serve`: interactive map of a repo's units, shared code and outside systems, with hover tracing, search, collapsible groups and a resizable sidebar.
- Plain-language process tracing through the Claude Code CLI (read-only tools), with code references read live from the checkout and GitHub links.
- Saved traces on disk and shareable trace codes.
- `repo-map init`, `repo-map generate` (Claude Code drafts the map) and `repo-map validate`.
